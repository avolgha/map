### What is it?

Mairus Admin Plugin or short `map` is a [Spigot](https://spigotmc.org) plugin, created by [me](https://github.com/avolgha), *Marius*

It adds a few features like vanish or teleporting to the server. *(all features you can see [here](https://github.com/avolgha/map/blob/dev/PROJECT.md))*

Feel free to create an [Issue](https://github.com/avolgha/map/issues) if you have questions. You can also contact me on discord (see `Support` section below) 

**WARNING**: This project is currently in progress, so not read. Watch this repository to get notified if I release a new update for the plugin

### Contributing

Feel free to open a pull request if you want to add features to the plugin. 

Your code has to match my code, so first have a look at it. Also, you have to add an entry to the [PROJECT.md](https://github.com/avolgha/map/blob/dev/PROJECT.md) file,
so that others can have a look at it.
